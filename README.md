FinLit which stands for financially literate is an application aimed to give the user the convenience to make smart financial decisions without the hassle of taking time out to do it themselves. Even though this app is targeted to everyone, it addresses a problem where many minorities are developing bad spending habits at a young age, which in turn creates a lack of strong financial structure for them to be successful in the future. FinLit focuses on asking the user very basic information about their finances and from that creating an organic relationship with the customer throughout time. By analyzing the user's debit card history the application can recognize bad spending habits and direct the customer on ways to better utilize their finances, allowing them to learn better spending habits effectively saving them more money. This will be accomplished by utilizing the nessie api and a web application using html and css. We also plan on gamifying this app by including a point system for users who stick close to their recommended spending plan compared to those who deviate from the plan. Users who accumulate more points could have the opportunity to obtain perks from their bank or sponsors of the application. This can also bode well as a score for the bank to see that the account holder is being responsible with his/her money which could provide a better relationship with the customer and bank.
